The words "Root Canal" often make patients nervous. But at Shifa Dental Clinic, we want you to know the truth: **The pain comes from the infection, not the cure.**

### What actually happens?
Inside your tooth, there is a small nerve. When bacteria gets deep inside, that nerve gets sick and causes severe pain.
A root canal simply removes that sick nerve. Once the nerve is gone, **the pain is gone.**

### Is it painful?
With modern anesthesia (numbing shots), a root canal feels very similar to getting a regular filling. Dr. Ahmed ensures you are 100% numb before we start. You should feel pressure, but not pain.

### Don't wait!
If you have a throbbing toothache, waiting only makes the infection worse. Save your tooth today!
