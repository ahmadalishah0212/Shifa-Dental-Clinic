Deciding to straighten your teeth is a big decision. At **Shifa Dental Clinic**, the most common question we get is: *"Should I get clear aligners or traditional metal braces?"*

Here is the honest breakdown to help you decide.

### 1. The "Invisible" Factor
* **Aligners:** They are made of clear plastic and are almost invisible. Most people won't even know you are wearing them.
* **Braces:** These use metal brackets and wires. However, modern braces are much smaller and more comfortable than they used to be!

### 2. The "Discipline" Factor (Important!)
* **Aligners:** You must remove them to eat and brush. This sounds great, but it means **you** are responsible for wearing them 22 hours a day. If you forget to put them back in, your teeth won't move.
* **Braces:** They are glued on. You don't have to remember to wear them—they work 24/7 automatically.

### 3. Which is faster?
For simple cases, clear aligners can be faster (6-12 months). for complex bite issues, traditional braces are often more powerful and efficient.

**Not sure which one you need?** Come in for a consultation. We will scan your teeth and show you exactly what your future smile could look like!
