We hear it all the time: *"I brush twice a day, isn't that enough?"*

The short answer: **No.**

### The "In-Between" Danger Zone
Imagine washing your hands but never washing between your fingers. That is what happens when you skip flossing.

A toothbrush bristles can only reach the front, back, and top of your teeth. They cannot get **between** them. This means if you don't floss, **40% of your tooth surface remains dirty** every single day.
